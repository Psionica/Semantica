# Semantic Knowledge Engine

This project consists of an algorithm which can compute semantic expressions. A semantic expressions is a finite combination of arithmetic operators and operands, where most operands are natural words.

Examples of semantic expressions:
```
King - man + woman = Queen

Russian - Russia + China = Chineese

humans + unity = peaceful_coexistence

god - human + earth = heavens
```
